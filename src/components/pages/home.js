                        Hello! I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker" target="_black">hacker</a>. Deeply curious about technology and human behaviour, I graduated from IIIT-H as an engineer with a master's in cognitive neuroscience.
                            <br /><br />
                            I've engineered systems at Samsung Research and a few early stage startups, developed widely-used apps for the Delhi Government and Indian Railways, and worked as a behavioral economics researcher at NTU, Taipei.
                            <br /><br />
                            I started my <i>career</i> as a backend engineer, but the latter of my curiosities drove me towards empathizing with users, and I work as a Product Manager today at <a href="https://enterpret.com" target="_black">Enterpret</a>, helping the best product teams on the planet learn from their customers' feedback.
                            <br /><br />
                            When I am not hacking on an idea, I challenge myself to go on adventures. I like coffee, non-fiction, and indie rock music. I share what I learn on <a href="https://twitter.com/vi_kaushal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">X</a>, and on my blog <a href="https://vivekkaushal.substack.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Empathetic Hacking</a>.
